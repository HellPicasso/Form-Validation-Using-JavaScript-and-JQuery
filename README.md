# Form-Validation-Using-JavaScript-and-JQuery
This is the new project which I've made using HTML,CSS and JavaScript with the help of JQuery module.


1. Make a folder named "XYZ Project"
2. Download and paste all the code files with their respective extentions i.e. .html, .css and .js.
3. Make sure to keep three files inside one single folder.
4. Run the html file in your default browser.
